I work on high-performance and portable systems for lossless data compression, with a focus on GPU and CPU parallelization (OpenCL, CUDA, OpenMP, MPI).

## Research focus
My current work explores portable parallelization of Adaptive Stream-based lossless compression across heterogeneous architectures, aiming for high throughput while preserving compression effectiveness on real datasets.

## Publications
- Yue Zhang, Yuki Hara, Oliver Sinnen, Shinichi Yamagiwa. "Parallelising Stream-Based Lossless Data Compression on GPUs and CPUs." Under review at International Workshop on Big Data eXploration, Compression and Systems (BDXCS), 2026.

## Selected projects
- Portable parallelization of adaptive stream-based lossless compression (OpenCL). Main implementation is currently in a private collaboration repository; summary and selected artifacts are shared here on GitHub.
- Coursework projects (selected). I only publish materials that do not violate course sharing rules; code is shared only when permitted.

## Interests
GPU and CPU performance engineering, memory-bound kernels, portable parallel programming, systems for real-time decision making.
